## ðŸ§© Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are blueprints of a website or app that show structure and functionality without detailed visuals. Key elements include:

### 1. **Layout Structure**  
Defines how elements like headers, footers, and content areas are arranged.  
**Example:** A header at the top, main content in the center, and a footer at the bottom helps guide user focus.

### 2. **Navigation**  
Shows how users move through the interface using menus or links.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar linking to "Home", "About", and "Contact" pages.

### 3. **Content Placement**  
Indicates where text, images, and other media will be displayed.  
**Example:** A featured section with a heading and button placed at the top of the homepage.

### 4. **Functionality**  
Outlines interactive elements like buttons, forms, and sliders.  
**Example:** A sign-up form with fields and a submit button shows how user input will work.

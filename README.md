## ðŸ§© Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are blueprints of a website or app that show structure and functionality without detailed visuals. Key elements include:

### 1. **Layout Structure**  
Defines how elements like headers, footers, and content areas are arranged.  
**Example:** A header at the top, main content in the center, and a footer at the bottom helps guide user focus.

### 2. **Navigation**  
Shows how users move through the interface using menus or links.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar linking to "Home", "About", and "Contact" pages.

### 3. **Content Placement**  
Indicates where text, images, and other media will be displayed.  
**Example:** A featured section with a heading and button placed at the top of the homepage.

### 4. **Functionality**  
Outlines interactive elements like buttons, forms, and sliders.  
**Example:** A sign-up form with fields and a submit button shows how user input will work.
## ðŸ§± Types of Wireframes

Wireframes vary in detail and purpose depending on the stage of the design process. The two main types are:

### ðŸ”¹ Low-Fidelity Wireframes  
These are simple, rough representationsâ€”often hand-drawn or created using basic shapes. They focus on layout, structure, and functionality without design elements like colors or fonts.  

**Use Case:**  
Used early in the design process to brainstorm ideas, gather feedback, and align on structure before committing to detailed design work.

**Example:**  
A black-and-white sketch showing placement of a navigation bar, content blocks, and footer with placeholder text.

### ðŸ”¸ High-Fidelity Wireframes  
These are more detailed and polished, often created with design tools. They closely resemble the final product and may include real content, font choices, spacing, and interactions.  

**Use Case:**  
Used in later stages to communicate final layout and user experience to developers and stakeholders.

**Example:**  
A grayscale wireframe showing an exact login form with real labels, button placement, and spacing aligned with the design system.
